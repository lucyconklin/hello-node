# Very Basic Node Hello World

This is a super basic app to get to know Node.js, external css stylesheets, and external js files.

## Getting Started

### Do you have node installed?
In your terminal type:
```
node -v
```
The `-v` is short for "version" and will tell you what version you are on.
If you see something like
```
node -v
v8.2.1
```
then you are in business!

If not go download Node and install it.

### Are you connected to Github?

### Now go get the repository and clone to your computer.
```
git clone https://github.com/lucyconklin/hello-node.git
cd hello-node
```
Now you can install and start your server (which is all set up for you) with:
```
npm install
npm start
```
It might take a little while because it will be installing Express.

Now navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to see your app!

### The Fun Part
I have added some truly horrendous styling to `style.css`, as well as an annoying alert to `script.js`. Go in and change things there.
